Re Creation of complex excel file

Initial used excel file from this website (http://www.twoinvesting.com/2017/10/dividend-stock-portfolio-spreadsheet-on-google-sheets/). Previously stock data was using yahoo, google, and IEX to pull data, plus complex excel functions within google sheets. Yahoo and google stopped or changed their access. IEX updated their API references in addition google sheets file was starting to take really long to load. So I am duplicating excel file in PHP and IEX cloud (since it is free).

IEX exchange (https://iexcloud.io/)
